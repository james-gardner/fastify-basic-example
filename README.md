# Fastify Example

Just a quick example I've thrown together for a blog post. This is aimed at giving you a feel how easy it is to get up and running with Fastify.
For the sake of the example I've used Postgres.

## Quick start

Get set up with a .env file if you need to override the defaults:

```
PGUSER=myusername
PGPASSWORD=mypassword
PGDATABASE=mydatabase
```

Then run:

```
  npm i
  npm run dev  
```

I've used node 20 for this example.
